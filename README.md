Teaching experience:
(1) Critically appraising a paper and medical statistics
23/10/2020
Teaching session for medical students to become reviewers for papers submitted to the Manchester Medical Journal. Two hour long lectures on how to critically review a paper and common errors with an example paper to read afterwards then common statistics required for medical review.
Reflection: My explanations can sometimes be drawn out which can confuse some students. Short succinct points can be readily understood and are more memorable. There is a balance to be struck between enough explanation to understand and enough brevity to remember. Feedback was positive considering the complexity of the content. 

(2) The AFP course and mock interview prep
23/11/2020
I was an  interviewer for the Manchester Medical Research Society’s AFP mock interviews and my performance was rated as good overall. My students particularly apprecited the feedback and teaching I gave on interview preparation.
Excerpts from students’ reviews following the session:
“Ashley was a brilliant interviewer, I felt comfortable and he encouraged me to expand my answers. I received useful feedback and learning points from Ashley’s own AFP experience, thank you for taking the time out to conduct the interviews!”
“Ashley Stokes - well run session with appropriate and constructive feedback. Thank you :)”
“Ashley Stokes was very good with feedback. Gave plenty of time and was very thorough and so helpful”

(3) Medical Statistics for AFP done for Manchester Medical School Research Society (MMRSoc)
24/11/2020
One hour lecture on medical statistics for AFP lectures including common medical research and statistical analysis mistakes. This was given to more than 50 Manchester Medical students with an interest in AFP . It received a “good overall” feedback.

Reflection: This was a good session with added details and questions. Much improved from the past session where the details were slightly overbearing and difficult to understand. It was difficult to discern the difference in ability between the groups however. In hindsight in larger groups it is best to be able to get feedback of ability during the session to tailor the complexity to the group as a whole.

(4) The Basics of ECGs and arrhythmias
17/12/2020
I gave a zoom lecture to more than 100 medical students on basic ECG interpretation for CardioSoc and University of Manchester. The feedback was overall good and there was a lot of participation as the majority of my slides were designed to invite discussion and encourage applying the knowledge I had just taught.

(5) Medical statistics Workshop for MRRSoc conference
16/04/2021 
A drop in zoom session whereby I could talk through choices and preferences of statistics use and when it is best to involve the statistics team as it was coming up to submission time for their audit and research projects. I also taught and aided basic interpretation of data from descriptive data to multinomial regression.

(6) How to Ace for Year 3 Research Project
10/05/2021
Short slides on how to “ace” the research project in medical school. Feedback was given on the good forms app and was well received. Please see attached PDF with feedback.

(7) Machine Learning and AI: Development of Clinical Teaching session
13/05/2021
I did a short 15 minute teaching session on very basic machine learning algorithms for the purposes of getting feedback on teaching styles and developing public speaking skills. I did this before all F1s in my hospital. I learnt that taking into account questions was very important as both a colleague and the assessor asked many questions throughout and this sadly used up much of the time.

(8) Critical review and medical statistics for reviewing submission for MMJ
30/10/2021
This was another session on statistics use and spotting errors in papers. This was for the purposes of doing critical review of submission for the student medical journal (Manchester Medical Journal) at the University of Manchester Medical School.

(9) Fluid therapies in raised ICP for Developing as a Clinical Teacher
10/3/22
Junior doctor teaching to the F2 cohort of ~90 people. Lecture based format. 
The feedback was that it was “clear, practical, relevant, had good use of a case study and had good audience participation”

(10) Severe PV haemorrhage audit meeting case for Developing as a Clinical Teacher
1/2/22
Second junior doctor teaching case. Done to the F2 cohort of ~90 people. Taught as more of a case discussion format and informal lecture. A surprising number of F2s managed to work out that this was a APML presentation before I had even given the full history. 

(11) Lessons learned teaching on common incidents and medicolegal repercussions in healthcare
9/6/22
Alongside AFP F1s.

(12) F1 teaching and presentation on Junior Doctor Burnout and seeking help 
7/7/22
Done alongside Imposter syndrome presentation. Motivated by discussion with new Junior doctor psychologist and recent results of the Royal Preston Hospital Burnout Research by Dr Jenny Gomersall.

(13) F1 teaching and presentation on Imposter syndrome
7/7/22
Done alongside Imposter syndrome presentation and equally motivated by presentation by Dr Jenny Gomersall.
Audit and QI:
(1) 	Exercise tolerance training ICE referral system QIP at East Lancashire Foundation Trust 
Completed cycle 22/11/21
QIP on baseline auditing inappropriate referrals for ETT and instigating an ICE referral system that filters patients with absolute contraindications. Completed jointly with an IMT colleague. 

(2) 	ECG signing and dating audit in East Lancashire Foundation Trust AMU
Completed 4/5/21
I assisted with data collection of ECGs of patients admitted to the Acute Medical unit. This was to test if ECGs have been safely reviewed and documented.

(3) 	Acute Coronary Syndrome Antiplatelet prescribing in East Lancashire Foundation Trust A&E
Data collection completed 29/10/21
Audit project with view to do QI on: If appropriate antiplatelet were prescribed for ACS patient given updated NICE guidance. The view of this project is if there is a failing in the system to produce a cardiac chest pain proforma to aid clerking and up to date management in the A&E department.

(4) 	Angiography and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention audit at West Middlesex University Hospital 
Completed 21/10/22
Audit project to assess complication rates and types in PCI patients. We categorised ~150 patients by complications and this is the baseline audit for a later QIP to see if there are interventions we can instigate to reduce complications. 

(5) 	NOAC prescribing and indications in the Community setting - University of Manchester  
Completed 4/2/19
Audit to assess patients to assess appropriate NOAC prescriptions given reduced renal function.


Change management:

(1)	Description of change: North West Desflurane and Nitrous Reducing Project (CLEAR NW - Consensus for Lowering Emissions in the Anaesthetic Room)

Date: 07/04/22

Aim & measure of the change: Number of Trusts committing action to lower Desflurane and Nitrous emissions

Description and importance: The CLEAR NW (Consensus for Lowering Emissions in the Anaesthetic Room) project will make the greatest effects as it is an inter-Trust project. As such multiple Trusts will reduce CO2 emissions so far each Trust cut 1000s tonnes CO2 equivalent emissions. Even more so, this has saved Nitrous costs (ELHT savings >£100,000s/year and similar results in central Manchester and Mersey also). This is likely due to there being numerous leaking Nitrous manifolds throughout NHS England. The goal was to connect and incentivise North West Trusts to reduce CO2 emissions by reducing Desflurane and Nitrous use. We now coordinate Net Zero Managers, 13 of 16 trusts, we plan to secure funding and collaborate with the North West Pharmacy Leads.

(2)	Ward Craft and Ward Round Documentation Task Group

Date: 08/08/21

Aim & measure of the change: implementing education and EPR changes

Description and importance: Following my investigations into ward round documentation issues (pace, legibility, doctors not speaking up) this group was set up involving Clinical Directors to help action the project. We decided on an education approach highlighting the legal benefit to documenting timings, indications and senior's input.

First author research and presentations:

(1)	BCS Abstract: Long term lead survival in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients: a retrospective analysis using clinical correspondence data mining.

Date: June 2018

Aim of research: I lead a preliminary study to assess lead survival in complex ACHD patients

Presented:
1)	Orally presented at National BCS 2018 and runner up of Best of the best abstracts
2)	Poster presentation as International Heart Rhythm Society 2018.

Conclusions/Actions: No significant differences between surgical and transvenous system leads. Transvenous were associated with a higher risk of infection, surgical leads had higher rates of failure. Orally presented as BCS 2018 and runner up of Best of the best abstracts.

(2)	Manchester Medical Research Society Conference: Review of appropriate non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in a UK primary care population

Date: March 2019

Conclusions: NOAC prescribing is generally well adhered to regarding creatinine clearance NICE guidance. Rivaroxaban is most associated with prescribing in patients with low creatinine clearance < 15.

(3)	ESC Abstract: Long-term lead failure and mortality following pacemaker and defibrillator implantation in adult congenital heart disease

Date: March 2022

Aim of research: I lead the full study to assess lead and patient survival in ACHD patients

Presented:
1)	Moderated poster presentation at European Cardiology Society Congress Barcelona September 2022
2)	Oral presentation at North West AFP conference at Salford Hospital June 2022
Conclusions/Actions: Complex ACHD had worse mortality. Lead survival was worse in non-surgical and male patients. No difference between epicardial/transvenous leads and patient survival(250 patients). Currently awaiting statistics, consultant and formatting before submission.

(4)	Manchester Medical Research Society Conference: Review of appropriate non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in a UK primary care population

Date: March 2019

Conclusions: NOAC prescribing is generally well adhered to regarding creatinine clearance NICE guidance. Rivaroxaban is most associated with prescribing in patients with low creatinine clearance less than 15.

(5)	U-Net 3D image machine learning segmentation of atrial and ventricular tissues from microCT 

 Date: Febuary 2018

Methods: Python coding, data handling of 3D images, data cleaning, image processing, machine learning modules (tensorflow and pytorch) 

Conclusion: due to low sample size and very variable dataset , machine learning methods are not reliable to separate tissues structures unless in a semi-supervised setting. 

(6)	Machine learning MI detection on PTB-XL ECG database 

 Date: Febuary 2018

Methods: 1D signal data handling and processing, python coding and building machine learning architecture such as neural networks in tensorflow and pytorch.

Conclusion: PTB-XL ECG database can be classified at a standard close to benchmark methods however there is no guarantee of implicit bias built into the architecture that discriminates if applied outside the dataset. The architecture often over fitted to bias features such as nurse doing ECG, patient age, sex, and other demographics.
